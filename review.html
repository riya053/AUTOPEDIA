         <div class="border border-success p-2 mb-2 border-opacity-25" > 
            This was one of those days I knew would be hard to beat for a long, long time. Glorious weather, twisty roads snaking through beautiful Italian countryside and a shocking blue Lamborghini Aventador LP 780-4 Ultimae roadster with the roof tucked away, all to myself.

            Exposed to the elements, the bellowing V12 engine inches behind my ears, an empty road in front of me and a clear sky above my head was a visceral driving experience, the likes of which only a Lamborghini can deliver. And this is not just any Lamborghini.<br>
            For over a decade, the Aventador has been the ultimate Lamborghini and the Ultimae (Latin for final or last) is the ultimate Aventador, the most extreme version yet. And true to its name, the Ultimae is not just the latest derivative of the monstrous Aventador, but the final one that marks the end of an 11-year run of this iconic supercar.

            <br> The Ultimae is also the last Lamborghini to use V12 power alone. The next-gen Aventador, due in 2023, will also be V12 powered, but will have an electric motor for company. Yes, future Aventadors will all be hybrids, and hence, the Ultimae, in this context, marks the end of an era of pure V12 combustion for Lamborghini. It’s an era that began in 1963 with the Italian marque’s first ever model, the 350 GT. Subsequently, the fabled Lamborghini Miura was the fastest car in the world when it was launched in 1966 and the 1974 Countach, a supercar that looked like it had come from outer space, all used V12 power as did their successors – the Diablo and Murcielago.

      <div class="border border-success p-2 mb-2 border-opacity-25">
        The temptation is too much. There, sitting pretty in the pitlane, is the one car I really want to drive around the MMRT. No, it isn’t a Porsche, it isn’t a BMW. It’s a Skoda (go figure). This, however, is no regular Skoda.<BR> Nothing less than the Slavia RS in drag, it gets 150hp of rippling muscle and a serious 250Nm of twist, all coiled up under the hood. The cherry on top? It even comes with a manual gearbox... Oh mama! 

The Slavia isn’t making it easy. It catches the light beautifully, the cuts and creases along the flanks stand out, and then, what makes it even more tempting is that the keys are right there. We even have the track to ourselves.<BR>
    The temptation, of course, is to immediately whack the throttle open everywhere. But I resist. Yes, I use all the performance on the straighter bits, and that delivers quite a rush, but in an effort to be smooth and not to trip over myself, I compartmentalise the down shifts, the braking, the turn in and the exit. This helps isolate things and since the car isn’t going flat out, I use the ‘spare capacity’ to think about how the car is behaving. I watch, I observe, I pay attention, and this tells me what makes this car tick.
<br>Have to say, first impressions are better than expected. This mainly has to do with body roll, of which I’m expecting a lot. And yes, the Slavia does roll. This is exacerbated by the fact that we are on a track and it has to deal with long corners that, unlike on a real road, go on and on. Still, body roll isn’t as bad as I expect. Remember, this car has an SUV-like ground clearance of 179mm, so the anti-roll bars are clearly working overtime  </div>

            <h4 class="border border-success p-2 mb-2">Tata Nexon EV Max review – Compels you to go electric</h4><br>
            The Tata Nexon EV has been a blockbuster, and for all the right reasons – it is cleverly packaged in terms of size and space, and it sensibly balances affordability and premium features on one hand, and battery size and overall performance on the other. Also, contrary to the notion that its usage will be limited within city confines, owners are using their Nexon EVs to the fullest for both intra-city and inter-city commutes and are reaping benefits of its lower running cost (compared to internal combustion engine vehicles). These EV owners have also played the role of brand ambassadors and have been rather vocal about their ownership experiences to influence the ones sitting on the fence. It’s no surprise then that this all-electric SUV is the bestselling EV in the country and it plays a key role in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in India at a mass-market level.<br>

                2022 Mercedes C-Class review: Feels like a junior S-Class
            </h4>
            Mercedes Benz first launched the C-Class in India back in 2001. Put on sale at a princely sum of Rs 21 lakh, the W203 featured a solid build, a common rail diesel engine and dynamics that managed to be both comfort oriented and sporty at the same time. Known as the baby S-Class, because it had an almost identical rear end, it kick-started India’s love affair with the C-Class, and Mercedes India hasn't looked back since. Now two decades and three full generations on, with several thousand cars sold in between, Mercedes is back with the all-new C-Class or W206, and from what we can tell, it deserves the baby S-Class tag even more. But just how much better is it compared to the earlier W205? And does it deliver what Indian buyers want in their luxury car? Just some of the questions answered below.<br> The new C is a baby S. Place one above the other in profile, stretch the C-Class, and what you get is a near mirror image. It’s that close. And the rears are even more of a match. The wedge-shaped rear, the slimline tail-lights, the clean and compact boot, they are indistinguishable from each other. And that, of course, isn't by accident. A strategy Mercedes has used successfully in the past, that the C-Class is easy to confuse with the S-Class, is clearly intentional.

            <h4 class="border border-success p-2 mb-2">Volkswagen Virtus review: New Honda City rival is a Jetta reborn</h4>
            The Volkswagen Virtus is the Skoda Slavia’s sister car. Similar in many ways, but also quite different, it is a replacement for the decade-old Vento. The big news is that the VW Virtus is a car that is better in pretty much every measurable way when compared to its predecessor. It is larger on the outside, bigger on the inside, and gets more power and performance under the hood. So just how much of a step up is it, how does it compare with rivals from Honda and Hyundai, and finally, is it a car that would keep you from joining the hordes thronging to SUVs? These and other questions answered in our first drive of what promises to be the best and most well-configured car Volkswagen has ever launched in India.<br>
            Since the Skoda Slavia and Volkswagen Virtus are very similar under the skin, they share a lot. But they also look very different, and this is basically down to each company’s individual approach. Where Skoda has gone for a sportier and more compact-looking nose, Volkswagen has chosen a more grown-up look. You can see this practically everywhere; from the manner in which the ‘squared’ nose of the Virtus has been fleshed out, to how chrome detailing has been used to help highlight important details. The Virtus, especially in the metal, looks as long in beam as a Jetta! This impression is reinforced when you see how far back the lines stretch, and then what makes Virtus look even more upmarket is the sophisticated detailing. The L-shaped LED strips merge seamlessly with the grille, the VW logo pops out nicely in 3D, and unlike the Slavia, has almost no cuts and creases on the bonnet. Even the partially blacked out tail-lights look both edgy and sophisticated.
