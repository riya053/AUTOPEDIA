         <div class="border border-success p-2 mb-2 border-opacity-25" > The cabinet has adopted the Tripura Electric Vehicle Policy, 2022, which aims to ..<br>
            Agartala, May 25 (IANS): To curb vehicular pollution and save fuel, the Tripura government has adopted the Tripura Electric Vehicle Policy 2022 to promote electric vehicles, officials said here on Wednesday.
  
              <br>A senior official of the Transport Department said that Tripura is the 15th state in the country and third in the northeastern region after Assam and Meghalaya to adopt the electric vehicle policy.
              
             <br> He said that the state cabinet headed by Chief Minister Manik Saha adopted the Tripura Electric Vehicle Policy 2022 to encourage people to use more and more electric vehicles in the state.
          
               The official said that there are 60,000 different types of vehicles in Tripura and the government has targeted to convert 10 per cent of these 60,000 vehicles into electric driven in the next five years.
  
             <br> According to the official, the electric vehicles policy is already in place in 14 states, including Assam and Meghalaya in the northeastern region of the country.
              
             <br> Meanwhile, in Tripura, over 12,000 vehicles including around 8,000 private cars and 3,800 auto-rickshaws are run by the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), provided by the state owned Tripura Natural Gas Company Limited (TNGCL).
              
              <br>The CNG is cheaper than the petrol and diesel and entirely pollution free.
              
              The TNGCL, a joint venture between GAIL (India) Ltd, Tripura Industrial Development Corporation Ltd and Assam Gas Company Ltd, is the first to set up CNG in 1990 in the entire eastern India.

            <h4 class="border border-success p-2 mb-2">Tesla to soon have self-driving cars without need for human drivers: Musk</h4><br>
            Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that his company will have self-driving cars without the need for having human drivers behind the wheel for supervision around the same time next year. Musk statement came on the sidelines of his visit to Brazil, wherein he launched a program to connect Amazonian regions with SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system.

According to a report by Electrek, this is not the first time that The Boring Company founder has made such claims. The report says Musk has been about Tesla launching robotaxis on road since 2019. “Next year for sure, we will have over a million robotaxis on the road…The fleet wakes up with an over-the-air update. That’s all it takes,” Musk wrote in a tweet back in October 2019.”

<br>However in 2020, Musk changed his time. Responding to a tweet he said that the regulatory approvals made the timeline of launch a bit uncertain.

<br>Then earlier this year, Musk said that Tesla planned to bring a dedicated robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals to market by 2024. His statement came on the sidelines of the company’s earnings call for the first quarter of 2022.

“I think can be very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production in 2024,” Musk said, adding, “I think [the robotaxi] really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.”

<br>Interestingly, Musk recently changed his claim of having “one million robotaxis by end of the year” to having “one million people in FSD (full self-driving) Beta”, the publication reported.

“The Full Self-Driving Beta at this point can very often take you with zero intervention across the Bay Area from San Jose to Marin through complex traffic…We got over 100,000 in the beta, so it’s not tiny, and we will be expanding that to probably 1 million people by the end of the year,” Musk said at the All-In Summit earlier this month.

                A short spin in the Tata Nexon EV max
            </h4>
            BHPian speedmiester recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Took a long 50+Kms test drive of the Nexon EV Max.<br>

Test drives car was available today at Key Motors, JP Nagar.

Spent more than an hour with the car. Won't talk much about the exteriors as it's pretty much the same as the Old one.<br>

On the inside, the addition of the ventilated seats is a welcome move, the addition of wireless charger, new console for gear selection, regen selection is well thought of. All controls fall into place easily. Not happy with the deletion of physical buttons for the music system.

The test drive car was showing a charge of 96%. The range shown was 349Kms in the city mode with regen at level 3 and with AC off.<br>

I drove mostly in eco mode with regen set at level 3 and Auto AC at 22 degrees. We were three adults in the car.

Addition of the auto hold means a slight tap of throttle is necessary to get the car moving. The weighted steering is a delight to hold and drive.<br>

The extra battery weight is felt, but not to the extent the drive is affected. The ride is sorted, but at low speeds you will feel the bumps.

The route was a mix of heavy bumper to bumper city traffic and about 35Kms of moderate to high speed drive on NICE road. When I started off the energy consumption was at 156Wh/Km, I brought it down to 86Wh/km by the time I entered NICE road. On open roads, the eco mode is more than sufficient for regular drive, but the sports mode takes to a whole new level, the brisk acceleration is a delight and I am sure I will be using it more often

<br>I drove it just as I would in my ICE car. Top speed can only be achieved in Sports mode and that number comes very quickly in this mode. Regen doesn't work with cruise control, that's one easy way to maintain good speeds and extend range.

Overall I drove 53.3Kms, the SOC was at 96% when I started and had come down to 79% when I stopped. The range was down to 259KMs from 338Kms.<br>

To extrapolate, a range of 300Kms in real world usage is very much possible with speeds between 80-100Kmph on the highways.

Delivery will start from June 1st week and waiting period will be 16-20weeks.<br>
